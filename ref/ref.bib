@article{Heikkila2000,
abstract = {Modern CCD cameras are usually capable of a spatial accuracy greater$\backslash$nthan 1/50 of the pixel size. However, such accuracy is not easily$\backslash$nattained due to various error sources that can affect the image$\backslash$nformation process. Current calibration methods typically assume$\backslash$nthat the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean$\backslash$nindependent and identically distributed random noise in the observed$\backslash$nimage coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the$\backslash$nmapping between the 3-D coordinates and the image coordinates. In$\backslash$ngeneral, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results$\backslash$nto be less accurate than expected. In this paper, a calibration$\backslash$nprocedure for precise 3-D computer vision applications is described.$\backslash$nIt introduces bias correction for circular control points and a$\backslash$nnon-recursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy$\backslash$nanalysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the$\backslash$ntheoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images$\backslash$nindicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error$\backslash$nconditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources$\backslash$nbecomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.},

@article{Zhang2002,
abstract = {We propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It is well suited for use without specialized knowledge of 3D geometry or computer vision. The technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthog- onal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSRVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},
