abstract = {Modern CCD cameras are usually capable of a spatial accuracy greater$\backslash$nthan 1/50 of the pixel size. However, such accuracy is not easily$\backslash$nattained due to various error sources that can affect the image$\backslash$nformation process. Current calibration methods typically assume$\backslash$nthat the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean$\backslash$nindependent and identically distributed random noise in the observed$\backslash$nimage coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the$\backslash$nmapping between the 3-D coordinates and the image coordinates. In$\backslash$ngeneral, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results$\backslash$nto be less accurate than expected. In this paper, a calibration$\backslash$nprocedure for precise 3-D computer vision applications is described.$\backslash$nIt introduces bias correction for circular control points and a$\backslash$nnon-recursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy$\backslash$nanalysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the$\backslash$ntheoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images$\backslash$nindicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error$\backslash$nconditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources$\backslash$nbecomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.},
