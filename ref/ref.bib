@article{Heikkila2000,
abstract = {Modern CCD cameras are usually capable of a spatial accuracy greater$\backslash$nthan 1/50 of the pixel size. However, such accuracy is not easily$\backslash$nattained due to various error sources that can affect the image$\backslash$nformation process. Current calibration methods typically assume$\backslash$nthat the observations are unbiased, the only error is the zero-mean$\backslash$nindependent and identically distributed random noise in the observed$\backslash$nimage coordinates, and the camera model completely explains the$\backslash$nmapping between the 3-D coordinates and the image coordinates. In$\backslash$ngeneral, these conditions are not met, causing the calibration results$\backslash$nto be less accurate than expected. In this paper, a calibration$\backslash$nprocedure for precise 3-D computer vision applications is described.$\backslash$nIt introduces bias correction for circular control points and a$\backslash$nnon-recursive method for reversing the distortion model. The accuracy$\backslash$nanalysis is presented and the error sources that can reduce the$\backslash$ntheoretical accuracy are discussed. The tests with synthetic images$\backslash$nindicate improvements in the calibration results in limited error$\backslash$nconditions. In real images, the suppression of external error sources$\backslash$nbecomes a prerequisite for successful calibration.},

@article{Zhang2002,
abstract = {We propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It is well suited for use without specialized knowledge of 3D geometry or computer vision. The technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthog- onal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.},
